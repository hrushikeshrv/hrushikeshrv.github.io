		<h1>DR. SHANTA VAIDYA MEMORIAL FOUNDATION</h1>

		<h1>Does My Child Have Dyslexia?</h1>
		<!--
		<p>
			Dyslexia affects the inner wirings if the brain, but it has no relationship to intelligence. Most often, dyslexia may be hereditary as the inner wirings of our brain are passed on to our next generation. If you feel like you faced difficulty in reading, writing, or math when you were young (or even now, for that matter), you may have dyslexia. If so, there is a chance that your child has dyslexia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if you did not experience any such difficulty, dyslexia can run in the family, so your child may still have dyslexia. If he/she shows good conversational intelligence, yet still falls behind in school because of poor reading, writing, or math skills, he/she may have dyslexia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dyslexia affects 1 out of 10 people in India. Please check our <a href='resources.html'>resources</a> page to find helpful material including the International Dyslexia Foundation's self-assessment tool.
